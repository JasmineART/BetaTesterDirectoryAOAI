Beta Docs 1.0

Release date: 2025-10-16

Highlights
- Clearer beta tester instructions: reorganized into concise, actionable sections (Access & login, Workflow & data import, Testing objectives, Feedback & bug reporting).
- Friendlier bug report template: shorter, approachable template to lower friction for testers.
- Report via GitHub: added a "Report via GitHub" button that pre-fills a friendly issue template.
- Star prompt: a small CTA encouraging testers to star the repository to follow progress.
- UI streamlining: simplified layout and lightweight styles for readability and faster scanning.

Notes
- Tailwind CSS is included via CDN for quick iteration; for production consider local build tooling.
- If you want tagged GitHub releases or a changelog, we can automate releases with GitHub Actions.
